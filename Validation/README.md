**Agitation** is an e-commerce framework, based on Symfony2, focussed on
extendability through plugged-in APIs, UIs, payment modules and other
components.

## AgitValidationBundle

This bundle provides an extendible validation service for the Agitation framework.

As opposed to the Symfony2 validators, it is not used for entity validation,
but can be used universally.

New validators can be registered through the pluggability infrastructure of
Agitation.
